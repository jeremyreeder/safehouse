						With five hundred pounds of suction, this suction-mount holds safe-drilling rigs
						quite well to a wide variety of safes.  It is designed for use with either of the
						following drill rigs:  the Lockmasters Magnum Bullet or the StrongArm Mini-Rig.
					</p>
					<img src="images/suctionmount.jpg" />
					<p>
						I no longer manufacture this tool for sale, but professional safe technicians
						can either make their own or buy the StrongArm Mini-Vac, which is similar.
					</p>
<!--
					<p>
						You can buy this tool for $165 (USD) plus $15.00 S&amp;H in North America, or
						contact me for a quote with intercontinental shipping.

					<p>
						Safe and vault work can be aided greatly by the use of appropriate software. The TSH
						Web-app Collection consists of two free web-applications developed by The Safe House
						for use by professional safecrackers and safe-technicians. If you have a strong
						knowledge of safe and vault locks, you should be able to use these applications
						easily. You can run them online or, alternatively, download the .ZIP archive for
						off-line use.

					<p>
						<a href="combo_generator.htm">
							Run ComboGenerator&#8482;! (an online web-app that generates pseudo-random combinations
							suitable for use with a combination lock)
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="geocracker.htm">
							Run GeoCracker&#8482;! (an online geometry web-app that performs vector addition and
							coordinate conversion, useful for calculating drill-points on safe and vault locks)

					<h3 id=cryptography>Free Cryptographic Software</h3>
					<p>
						If you're in need of strong encryption software that is fast
						and free, then CIPHERSABER is for you.  Designed by Arnold
						Reinhold, it incorporates Ron Rivest's well-known ARC4
						stream-cipher algorithm â€” an lgorithm which, since its
						introduction in 1987, has worked surprisingly well
						considering its simplicity.  Among other enhancements,
						CipherSaber improves upon ARC4 by applying a random 10-byte
						initialization-vector to each message's encryption.  This
						drastically improves the security and usability of the
						algorithm without sacrificing its speed, efficiency, and
						simplicity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Speed and efficiency are important because they allow CipherSaber to run well even
						within very low-cost devices. Simplicity in a crypto-system is desirable because it
						facilitates complete security analysis. If a system is too complex to be understood,
						then it is almost certainly insecure and may even contain intentional back-doors.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've implemented the CIPHERSABER-2 algorithm in C. My implementation generates its
						initialization vectors using the ARC4 pseudo-random byte-stream generator (seeded with
						the current time, process ID, and memory location), thereby making the output both
						unique and indistinguishable from random noise. This helps to assure the security of
						your encrypted data and to hide the fact that you're using encryption software. (If some
						despotic ruler prohibits encryption or requires that you grant access to your
						data, then it will be advantageous to defy such bogus laws in secret.)
					</p>
					<p>
						In the interest of promoting the availability of encryption technology world-wide, my
						CipherSaber is hereby placed in the public domain and is freely available for any use
						whatsoever. As far as I'm concerned, everyone everywhere has the right to unrestricted
						use of this software.

							compiles with GCC in Linux or with Visual C in MS Windows)

![A mastery of lock-manipulation skills enables me to open many locks and safes
relatively quickly through non-invasive methods. But when necessary, I use a
powerful safe-drilling rig, tungsten-carbide drill bits, and other specialized
tools to penetrate drill-resistant barriers.][drill-rig] ![Jeremy Reeder,

# Does your safe or vault need maintenance?
Well-maintained safes are easier to operate and more secure than their
neglected counterparts. By performing proper annual maintenance, I can correct
problems with your safe lock before they become severe. Without this
maintenance, the lock will, in fact, stop working. This can have either of two
undesirable results: you can't open your safe, or your safe is left vulnerable
to burglary. This tends to defeat the purpose of having a safe. If your safe or
vault has any of these symptoms, or if it's been a while since its last
professional service, give me a call.

# Do you need a good safecracker?
If you're locked out of your safe, I can help. Perhaps you neglected the
aforementioned maintenance, which you may not have realized was needed. Or
maybe, for whatever reason, the combination is simply not known. Don't worry. I
can open your safe. As for the state of the safe afterward, it will be secure
and functional, not broken.

I'll help you open your own safe, but of course I won't help you rob anyone. I
get asked to do that from time to time, but I'm really not interested.

# Has a burglar damaged your safe?
Burglars tend to favor safecracking methods that involve brute force and large
hammers. They break off dials and handles, cut hinges, and in general smash
things up. Fortunately, these popular methods are largely unsuccessful. (Safe
manufacturers, after all, did think of these methods in their designs.) If your
safe has been the victim of such demolition, you may be left with no way to
open the safe. You'll be happy to know that I can open such a safe and can
usually repair it.

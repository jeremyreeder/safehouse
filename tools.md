# Tools of the Trade
With five hundred pounds of suction, this suction-mount holds safe-drilling
rigs quite well to a wide variety of safes. It is designed for use with either
of the following drill rigs: the Lockmasters Magnum Bullet or the StrongArm
Mini-Rig.

I made this tool myself by adapting a big bad hand-pumped suction device. I do
not manufacture this tool for sale. If you're a professional safe technician in
need of such a tool, you can either make your own or buy the StrongArm
Mini-Vac, which is similar.

# Free Safe-lock Software

Safe and vault work can be aided greatly by the use of appropriate software.
The Safe House™ provides two free web-applications for use by professional
safecrackers and safe-technicians. If you have a strong knowledge of safe and
vault locks, you should be able to use these applications easily. You can run
them online or, alternatively, download the .ZIP archive for off-line use.

- [Run ComboGenerator™!][combogenerator] (an online web-app that generates
  pseudo-random combinations suitable for use with a combination lock)
- [Run GeoCracker™!][geocracker] (an online geometry web-app that performs
  vector addition and coordinate conversion, useful for calculating
  drill-points on safe and vault locks)
- [Download ComboGenerator™ & GeoCracker™ for offline use][download-apps]

				<li>The functions of the safecracking geometer are as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>It converts coordinates between polar and Cartesian systems.
							<ul>
								<li>
									The polar coordinate system used here is the safecrackers' standard,
									where angles are measured clockwise from top dead center.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>It converts length units between 'in' &amp; 'mm'</li>
						<li>It converts angular units between dials of different graduations.</li>
						<li>It accomodates crackers of indirect-drive safe locks by adding vectors: p1 + p2 = p3,
							<ul>
								<li>where p1 is the wheelpack center relative to the dial center,</li>
								<li>p2 is a drill point relative to the wheelpack center,</li>
								<li>&amp; p3 is the same point but measured relative to the dial center.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>It displays all data graphically, in actual size, in a style based partly on the HUD of a fighter jet.
							For printing, the HUD background is automatically converted to white.
							<ul>
								<li>
									The dial position is represented by green crosshairs.
									<img id=dial src="images/crosshairs-dial.gif" />
								</li>
								<li>
									The wheelpack position is represented by gray crosshairs.
									<img id=wheelpack src="images/crosshairs-wheelpack.gif" />
								</li>
								<li>The drill point is represented by a gray dot.
									<ul>
										<li>
											A green target square is positioned at the drill point based on p2.
											<img id=target src="images/target.gif" />
										</li>
										<li>
											A green aim diamond is positioned at the drill point based on p3
											&amp; should be aligned with the target.
											<img id=aim src="images/aim.gif" />
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>One application of the geometer is as follows, for an indirect drive lock:
					<ol>
						<li>Enter Cartesian coordinates (x, y) for wheelpack center (p1) in inches.</li>
						<li>Switch to millimeters, automatically converting previously entered data.</li>
						<li>Enter polar coordinates (angle x radius) for drill point (p2) in millimeters
							<ul>
								<li>(because this measurement happens to come from overseas).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Switch back to inches, if that's what you prefer to use.</li>
						<li>You now have your drill point, from dial center, in both polar &amp; Cartesian coordinates.
							Take your pick.
							<ul>
								<li>The StrongArm Uni-Temp uses Cartesian coordinates.</li>
								<li>For manual positioning, use polar coordinates if preferred.</li>
								<li>The web page can also be printed and used as a template.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>For a direct drive lock, simply leave the default coordinates for p1, as p2 is all that applies.</li>
